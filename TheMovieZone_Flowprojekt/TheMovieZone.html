                Science fiction film is a film genre that uses science fiction:
                speculative, science-based depictions of phenomena that are not 
                necessarily accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial life forms, 
                alien worlds, extrasensory perception, and time travel, 
                often along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, or other technologies. 
                Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, 
                and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, 
                tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or 
                at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which 
                written science fiction is traditionally held.
                <br>
                The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Melies' 
                A Trip to the Moon (1902) amazed audiences with its trick photography effects. 
                The next major example in the genre was the 1927 film Metropolis. 
                From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B-movies. 
                After Stanley Kubrick's 1968 landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey, the science fiction 
                film genre was taken more seriously. In the late 1970s, big-budget science fiction 
                films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success 
                of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades.
